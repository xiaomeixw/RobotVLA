# RobotVLA
A small VLA model, attempting to train the robot using the VLA model to explore the implementation of cutting-edge technological solutions。Convert language commands or visual commands into motion commands。

The purpose of the project is to enable the training of robot movements using any visual model. The robot's movements are implemented in a code pattern similar to function calls, which can be integrated with different robots. Instead of training with robot-specific data, the project aims to achieve a universal form that covers all known or unknown robot shapes.
